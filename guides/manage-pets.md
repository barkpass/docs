## Mark Pet as Inactive

Users may request that their pet be marked inactive for any number of reasons.

To mark a pet as inactive from the administrative interface, either find the pet by viewing the **Application** it belongs to and clicking on the Eye view icon, or by using the global search at the top of the screen.

Next, click the Edit button, and check the **Inactive** box.

Users may also mark their own pet as inactive by visiting the [pets dashboard](https://www.barkpass.com/pets) and clicking on the Trash icon.

::: warning Deleting Pets
Users are unable to delete pets if they are part of a "finalized" application, e.g. pending, approved, or rejected. In that case, they may only mark the pet as inactive. This is important for record-keeping purposes.
