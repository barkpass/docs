# Approve an Application

To approve an permit application, first log into an administrator account for your city. Once logged in, navigate to the applications tab on the left side of the screen.

You should see a list of pending, approved, or rejected applications, but we are only focusing on the **pending applications**.

Click the **View icon** for the application you'd like to approve.

Inside the application detail page, verify that the user's pets contain the required information, as well as all the required document types.

When you're ready to approve the application, select "Approve Application" from the actions dropdown in the top-right.

The application should now have a green approved label next to it instead of the yellow pending, and the application is now approved.

This will also **automatically generate Passes** for each of the pets in the application, and send the user an email notification letting them know that their application has been approved.
