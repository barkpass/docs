# Approve an Application

To approve an permit application, first log into an administrator account for your city. Once logged in, navigate to the applications tab on the left side of the screen.

You should see a list of drafted, pending, approved, or rejected applications, but we are only focusing on the pending applications.

Find the little square to the left side of the application you want to approve and click it.

Once the box has a little green check mark in it, go above the application list and find a box with the words "select action" in it.

Click the little arrow in the box and you should see a drop-down list with options to approve, reject, or to process an in-person application. Choose the option that says "Approve Application".

After you have selected approve, press the green arrow right next to it to finish approving the application.

The application should now have a green approved label next to it instead of the yellow pending, and the application is now approved.
