# Mark an Application as Inactive

Occasionally, an approved application will need to be marked as **inactive**. 

Reasons for marking an application inactive might include:

* The application is for a single pet, and the pet is no longer with the user (due to death, surrender, etc)
* The user is deceased or has moved out of the city.
* The city wishes to revoke access to the dog park.
* The user no longer wishes to retain access to the dog park or receive messages.

The following reasons should **NOT** be used to mark an application as inactive:

* The user has an unpaid invoice. Applications with unpaid invoices are automatically filtered out of the recipients list for Messages sent by the city, and are automatically updated once an invoice is paid in full.

To mark an application as inactive, visit the application in the admin interface and select Mark Inactive from the dropdown in the upper right:

If the application was marked inactive in error, or the city wishes to reactivate the application, the **Mark Active** option will be present:
