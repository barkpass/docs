_If the person already has a Barkpass account, skip to Step 2_.

**Note**: If the user does not use email, leave the Email and Password fields empty, and check the **No Email** box. This will generate a randomized email address for the user and ensure no email notifications are sent to them. If the user wants to set up a Barkpass account in the future, you can simply update their email address.
