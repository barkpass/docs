# Process Offline Applications

To process an application for in-person or over the phone transactions, complete the following steps:

## 1. Create an application

1. Visit the **Applications** tab on the left.
1. On the right, click **Create Application**.
1. Select the User by searching for their name or email. If the user does not yet exist, click **Create** to the right of the user box. This allows you to create a new user in a pop-up without leaving the page.

::: tip
If the user does not use email, leave the Email and Password fields empty, and check the **No Email** box. This will generate a randomized email address for the user and ensure no email notifications are sent to them. If the user wants to set up a Barkpass account in the future, you can simply update their email address.
:::

4. Select the Form for which they'd like to apply.
5. Click **Create Application** when finished.

## 2A. Add Pets and Documents to the Application (New Pets Only)

If the user is new to the system, you can add pets and documents to the application using a action from the top-right dropdown called **Add Pets and Documents**.

::: warning Users with existing pets
If the user has already created an application (for a prior year, for example), all of their pets will be **transferred automatically** when starting a new application. Be sure to double-check the pets listed in the newly-created application before adding new pets.

If you need to add new documents to existing pets, [skip to Step 2B](#_2b-add-documents-to-existing-pets-existing-pets-only).
:::

![Add documents and pets dropdown](/images/uploads/add-documents-and-pets-action.png)

Complete the form by adding the pet's information, followed by one or more documents for the pet.

After selecting a file, be sure to add any applicable expiration dates.

If you need to add another document, click the **Plus button** on the right side of the document.

Likewise, if you need to remove a document, click the **Minus button**.

When you're finished adding the pet and its documents, click the **Add Pets and Documents** button. The application should then be refreshed to reflect the new pet, including a total price based on residency or any other rules set for the form.

## 2B. Add Documents to Existing Pets (Existing Pets Only)

If the user has already started an application (for a prior year, for example), you may wish to add additional documents for an existing pet.

To do so, on the Application screen, scroll down to the Pets section, and click on the **Eye icon** to view the pet that requires new documents.

![View pet](/images/uploads/view-pet.png)

On the pet detail page, select the **Add Documents** action from the top right:

![Add documents action](/images/uploads/pet-add-documents-action.png)

Add one or more documents. Don't forget to add any applicable expiration dates for each document.

![Add documents form](/images/uploads/pet-add-documents-form.png)

If you need to add another document, click the **Plus button** on the right side of the document.

Likewise, if you need to remove a document, click the **Minus button**.

When you're finished, click the **Add Documents** button. The pet should then be refreshed to reflect the new document.

To return to the application, you can click **Applications** in the left menu.

::: tip
Don't forget to update the filter in the top right of the Applications list to include **Drafts**, as the latest application you created will not yet be pending (and won't be displayed in the index by default.)
:::

## 3. Process Payment and Approve Application

At the top right of the Application detail page, selec the **Process And Approve Offline Application** action from the dropdown.

![Process offline application dropdown](/images/uploads/process-offline-application.png)

Select the payment method (credit card, check or cash), and fill out the form.

::: warning Authorizing Credit Cards
Before approving a credit card payment, you MUST first authorize the payment by clicking the first green button. After the card has been authorized, you can then approve the application.
:::

::: tip Email Receipts
By default, a receipt will not be emailed to the user. This is useful in cases where you will be printing a receipt for the user in-person. However, if the transaction is taking place over the phone, you should check the **Send Email** option to ensure a receipt is emailed to the user (along with any access code information).
:::

When ready, click **Approve Application** to approve the application and process the payment.

That's it! As a result of this:

* The application's status will be automatically changed to **Approved**.
* Passes will be automatically generated for each pet.
