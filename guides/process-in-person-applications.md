# Process In-Person Applications

To process an application for in-person transactions, complete the following steps.

## 1. Create the user

_If the person already has a Barkpass account, skip to Step 2_.

1. Visit the **Users** tab on the left.
2. Click on the green **Create User** button.
3. Complete the form with the user's information, and click the green **Create User** button to submit.

**Note**: If the user does not use email, leave the Email and Password fields empty, and check the **No Email** box. This will generate a randomized email address for the user and ensure no email notifications are sent to them. If the user wants to set up a Barkpass account in the future, you can simply update their email address.

## 2. Start an Application For the User

1. Visit the **Applications** tab on the left.
2. On the right, click **Create Application**.
3. Select the User you just created in Step 1, and the Form for which they'd like to apply.
4. Click **Create Application** when finished.
