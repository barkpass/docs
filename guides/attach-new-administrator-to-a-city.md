# Attach new administrator to city

**Note**: If the administrator does not yet have a Barkpass account, you'll want to create one for them under "Users > Create User." Then proceed with the instructions below.

Log into your administrator account. Once at the dashboard, on the left side, click "Cities"

**Note**: If you cannot find the user, it's possible they already have a Barkpass account but are not yet connected to the current city. In this case, contact Barkpass support: support@barkpass.com
