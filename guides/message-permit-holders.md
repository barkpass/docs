# Message Permit Holders

Messages are a way to communicate with your permit holders directly in Barkpass. They are sent using the Barkpass email service, meaning you don't have to worry about setting up an email list in-house.

In creating a message, you'll be able to select a **Form** (e.g. 2020 Dog Park) which represents a group of **Applications** — and, by extension, a group of **Users**.

## Message Recipients

::: tip Included Recipients
* all **approved applications** for the selected form
* any additional recipients specified in the Message
:::

::: danger Excluded Recipients
* any applications marked as **inactive**
* any applications with **unpaid invoices**
* any excluded recipients explicitly listed in the Message
* any users who were created by administrative staff and did NOT have an email address initially added to their account
:::

## Create Message

Log into your administration account and on the left side choose "Messages"

In the top right corner, click "Create Message"

![Create message button](/images/uploads/create-messages.png)

Type your message and choose your recipients from that screen.

If you'd like to prevent sending the message to certain users, add their email addresses in a comma-separated list to the **Excluded Recipients** section.

When finished, click the "Create Message" at the bottom.

## Send Message

Once the message is complete at the top right corner click on "Select Option" and go down to "Send Message"
