# Handle Outstanding Balances

If a user owes additional money on an application, and you have NOT yet approved the application, you can reject the application to inform the user that they owe additional money. The user will be able to make the payment online.

**Note**: Has the application already been approved? You need to generate an invoice instead. Read about [Generating an Invoice for an Outstanding Balance](/guides/generate-an-invoice-for-an-outstanding-balance.html).

To handle an outstanding balance for a citizen with a pending application, first log into the administrator account for your city. Once logged in, navigate to the application section on the left side of the screen.

You'll see the list of applications and their related statuses. Click on the eyeball icon next to the application you wish to view.

Once in the application details, you'll see the amount for the outstanding balance.

At this point, you can **Reject** the application, and let the user know that their application has an outstanding balance. The user will be sent an email with a link to their application, where a new banner will be available detailing how much money they owe, along with a credit card form to settle the balance:

Once the user pays the outstanding balance online, their application status will return to **Pending**, where it can be approved when ready.

## Settle Outstanding Balance In-Person

If the user wishes to pay their outstanding balance in-person or over the phone, you can do so through the admin interface.

To settle the outstanding balance, navigate to the action dropdown and select "Settle Outstanding Balance."

If the payment type is credit card, you'll need to click the "Authorize Card for $XX" button" before clicking the "Settle Outstanding Balance" button. For cash and check, just click "Settle Outstanding Balance" once you have the payment information entered.

Once the outstanding balance is settled, the user's application status will automatically be set to **Approved**.
