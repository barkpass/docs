# Reject (Request Changes) to an Application

To request changes/reject an application, first log into the administrator account for your city. Once logged in, navigate to the application section on the left side of the screen.

Once you are in the application list, find the application that you want to reject. It should have a yellow pending tag on the right.

Once you have found the right application, check the little box on the left of the name.

Once a green check mark appears, navigate up above the application list to a little dropdown menu.

The application should now have a red "rejected" tag on it instead of a pending one, and the application is now rejected.
