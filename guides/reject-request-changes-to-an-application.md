# Reject (Request Changes) to an Application

To request changes/reject an application, first log into the administrator account for your city. Once logged in, navigate to the application section on the left side of the screen.

Once you are in the application list, find the application that you want to reject. It should have a yellow pending tag on the right.

Click the **Eye icon** to view the application.

Select **Reject Application** from the dropdown in the top right.

Be sure to add a reason for rejecting the application, which will be sent in an email notification to the user and displayed when they load their application in the web browser.

The application should now have a red "rejected" tag on it instead of a pending one, and the application is now rejected.

When the user makes the required changes, their application will switch back to the "pending" state automatically.
