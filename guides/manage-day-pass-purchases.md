## Process Offline Day Pass Purchases

If a customer would like to purchase a day pass in-person or over the phone, an administrator can manage the purchase through the admin interface.

First, visit **Day Passes** by clicking on the link in the left-hand menu. Then, on the top right, click on the green **Create Day Pass** button:

Next, fill in all the required information to create a Day Pass. Don't forget to enter a valid Total Price - this will be how much money is accounted for in the Transaction during the next step. 

When you're finished, click the green **Create Day Pass** button at the bottom right.

Finally, you MUST process the Day Pass as an offline transaction in order for the accounting to be registered in the system. 

From the top-right menu, select **Process Offline Transaction**.
