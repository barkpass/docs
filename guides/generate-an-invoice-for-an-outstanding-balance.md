title: Generate an Invoice for an Outstanding Balance
---
If an application has **already been approved**, but the user has an outstanding balance (e.g. they entered an invalid address), you may generate an invoice for the outstanding amount.

**Note**: Is the application still pending? You do not need to generate an invoice. Read about [Handling Outstanding Balances](https://docs.barkpass.com/guides/handling-outstanding-balances.html) instead.

Visit the application with an outstanding balance in the admin interface. From the dropdown in the upper right, select **Generate Invoice**.

Next, enter a description for the invoice. Optionally choose a Due Date for the invoice which will be displayed to the user.

Finally, click **Generate and Send Invoice**.

The user will receive an email notifying them that an invoice is available to view. They can open the invoice in their web browser and pay it with a credit card.

After the user pays the invoice, a receipt will be emailed to them. They can also view their receipt online:
